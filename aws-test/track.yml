teaser: Learn how to build tracks with an AWS account
description: |-
  Learn how to use a sandboxed AWS account in your Instruqt track.

  **This track demonstrates how to:**
    - Link an AWS cloud account to your sandbox
    - How to use the cloud client Docker container
    - Use the AWS CLI and UI from our learn environment
    - Limit usage of the cloud account using IAM and SCP policies

  The default settings of this track only allow t2.nano sized ec2 instances. You should adjust the IAM policy to fit your own use case and application size.
